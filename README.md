# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

for Developers:

first of all, i have created the react app using its default commands,then installed the required packages react-router-dom,bootStrap,axios,react-icon,moving forward I fetched data  from the pokemon api, then i have seen that there is buildin pagination so i didnot use my custom pagination.
after feching the data i have stored in variable which can easily accessable by any component via props or useContext hook.
then this data is passed to other nested component to do multiple operation like searching and adding to favorite,comparing
for searching, i have an input field through which i store user'svalue into state/variable using useState which is also a hook for managing data. then filtering the data this keystokes.
furthermore, i added id of particular pokemon into the array and stored this array to firebase.
i installed firebase to store my favourite data into the firebase, which can easily useable even after refreshing the browser.
 i also compared the one pokemon against others to check which is has more power
